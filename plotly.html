</div>


<div id="problem-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>Lets make some graphs using <code>plot.ly</code> and the
<code>p8105.datasets</code> package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(viridis)

library(p8105.datasets)</code></pre>
<p>I’ll be using the <code>ny_noaa</code> dataset to create my graphs
and flexdashboard. I’m curious to see what the weather was like in three
different regions of New York in 2005.</p>
<p>First, let’s clean up our data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(&quot;ny_noaa&quot;)

ny_noaa =
  ny_noaa |&gt;
  mutate(name = recode(id, 
                      &quot;USW00094728&quot; = &quot;Central_Park&quot;, 
                      &quot;USW00014733&quot; = &quot;Buffalo&quot;,
                      &quot;USC00308746&quot; = &quot;Tupper_Lake_Sunmount&quot;), 
         tmin = as.numeric(tmin) / 10, 
         tmax = as.numeric(tmax) / 10, 
         prcp = (prcp) / 10) |&gt;
  filter(
         year(date) == 2005,
         name %in% c(&quot;Central_Park&quot;, &quot;Buffalo&quot;, &quot;Tupper_Lake_Sunmount&quot;),
         if_all(c(prcp, snow, snwd, tmax, tmin), ~!is.na(.))) |&gt;
  select(name, date, prcp, snow, snwd, tmax, tmin)</code></pre>
<p>Now, let’s compare the distribution of temperature in Central Park
(Manhattan), Buffalo, and Tupper Lake Sunmount using a density plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ny_noaa |&gt;
  select(name, tmax, tmin) |&gt; 
  pivot_longer(
    tmax:tmin,
    names_to = &quot;observation&quot;,
    values_to = &quot;temp&quot;) |&gt; 
plot_ly(x = ~temp, color = ~name, colors = viridis(3), type = &quot;histogram&quot;, histnorm = &quot;probability density&quot;) |&gt; 
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = &quot;Temperature (°C)&quot;),
    yaxis = list(title = &quot;Density&quot;),
    title = &quot;Distribution of Temperature (2005)&quot;,
    showlegend = TRUE
  )</code></pre>

<p>Buffalo gets a lot of snow, and I’m not surprised that Central Park
has the largest annual rainfall. I wonder what the correlation is
between <code>snow</code> and <code>snowd</code>. Let’s make a scatter
plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ny_noaa |&gt;
  select(snow, snwd, name) |&gt;
  plot_ly(x = ~snow, y = ~snwd, color = ~name, type = &quot;scatter&quot;, mode = &quot;markers&quot;, colors = &quot;viridis&quot; ) |&gt;
  layout(
    title = &quot;Snow vs. Snow Depth (2005)&quot;,
    xaxis = list(title = &quot;Snowfall (mm)&quot;),
    yaxis = list(title = &quot;Snow Depth (mm)&quot;),
    showlegend = TRUE)</code></pre>
